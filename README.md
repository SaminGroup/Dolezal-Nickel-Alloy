# Dolezal-Nickel-Alloy

These directories support the investigation I did on the corrosion resitance of Ni-Nb-W to chlorine

011/ -- this directory holds the structure and data for the clean surface slab model that was eventually attacked with chlorine.

AttackData/ -- this directory holds the majority of the data that was generated and analyzed for the study. Here is where adsorption/desorption/vacancy formation energies were calculated and plotted. Each directory within this directory is named to correspond with the chlorine coverage it investigated.

DOS-and-elastic-constants/ -- the PDOS data and scripts as well as the elastic constant outcar and scripts for the bulk MC2 structure

adsorption/ -- the data from the eight-site 1/15 ML chlorine study
